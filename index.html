                    When it comes to my personality, I seem cynical to most people because
                    I let numbers and data dictate my actions and not emotions, and when people
                    figure out what that looks like they ask me all sorts of questions because they
                    find my answers weird and funny at the same time, makes the conversations with me
                    very interesting.

                        The only work experience I have that could be relevent in this field is
                        my time in the military, where I had the postion of grenade launcher partner,
                        which needed a lot of coordination between me, my partnet and everyone else in my squad,
                        to complete an objective, coordination and communication was the biggest key to success, making
                        team work while
                        doing separate assigments second nature.

                                I personaly think this project is a bad example as I had a tight deadline and had to scale it down a lot.

                        Watching TV shows and Playing Video games the normal stuff most Introverted people do. My favorite past
                        time is when my curiosity sparks and I go learn something I didn't knew before it can be anything from programming 
                        to how to increase the brains computing power or basic psychology to predict future human behaviour.
